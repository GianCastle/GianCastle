I will be by your side to help you with the heartache.

To hold your hand and show you, by your side is where I am.

To listen of you need to talk, to know how your feeling.

Or to just sit with you in silence...

To be there to catch you if you fall.

A shoulder to cry on.

Someone to wipe away your tears.

To be there during your worst and darkest fears.

What ever I gotta do, I will, to let you know I'm always here.

If you need to get on your knees and pray,

I'll be right beside you, all the way.

To help you with what you need to say.

And I pray for you every day.

Whatever life throws at you I am here to help you fight.

And to do my best to make each day for you happy and bright.

Do what I got to, to shed a little light in you life.

Through the good, the bad, the best or the worst I am right here.

To lend a ear, when you need to talk.

No matter what, I'll always have your back.

Just remember your never alone.

You got family and friends, that cares and loves you, right here.

I love you very much.

I've always been right here and here is where I'll always stay.
You can always call me if your upset or afraid, and remember...

**Never hesitate, my ANPS**
