Underneath the moonlit sky, and a beneath a blanket of stars.
While we lay in a land afar.

It's so quiet; all we can hear
Is our breath we vaguely take with us so near.

Are bodyâ€™s bound, lost in this presence, where we can't be found.

You kiss my neck; it feels so nice...
You have me feeling so enticed.

As your body emerges, Yearns and its urges
As you feel my embrace.

I want to taste your taste.

As I put it in
As little smiles and grins.

You whisper, faster?
Or should you scream love you Master?

Pulling your hair, feeling, as if I you are floating on air, as we tremble and begin to shake.

Now we quiver and quake.
Underneath the moonlit sky, beneath a blanket of stars.
